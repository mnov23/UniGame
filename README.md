To run the game open up "run_flash_app.exe" and then press "File" -> "Open" or
Press "Ctrl + O" and then specify the location of "DodgeOrSplodge.swf" then press "OK".

Enjoy!


You might need Adobe Flash Player or some external software to run it properly, perhaps...
but that's none of my concern as it is outdated crap out of service not even supported by Adobe themselves.
